# rainwater collection
* [capitol container corp](http://capitolcontainer.com/) - obtain a food-grade water drum from here
* place barrel on cinderblocks or pallets to increase water pressure (1 foot height = 0.5 psi)
* put screen over barrel and have hose dump into it without puncturing it (this filters out debris, mosquitoes and other animals)
* install 0.75" bulkhead for compatibility with hoses
* "foul flush system" for discarding initial sediment
* possibly collect water from rainspout one floor up
