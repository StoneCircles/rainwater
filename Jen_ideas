In my mind, at least in a knee-jerk sense, the most obvious usage of rainwater is essentially as greywater that doesn't require any processing; use it for watering gardens, flushing toilets, etc.

Keeping out bugs, leaves, etc.  is desirable no matter what; will a simple screen + physical break keep mosquitoes out in warmer months? Hopefully. 

A couple more challenges I can potentially think of are A) capturing moisture from snow effectively and B) ensuring that this water can be used reasonably close to where it is collected.
